                                Ground orders mostly get delivered in 3 to 7 business days. But some orders take longer than 7 days to be delivered. Truck freight orders might be delivered in 7-12 business days. The deliveries of truck
                                freight orders mainly get scheduled through shipping carrier and required a valid phone number of customers.

                                Make yourself know that we are not responsible for any losses took place and packages being received by someone in your absence. It is your responsibility to make some available when delivery takes place.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You can contact us via the support form available on our website and obtain a tracking number to investigate when delivery is done to your home or business area. If the shipper fails to take a sign of your
                                package or fraudulent sign is there then we will not be reimbursed for parts.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We can only file lost or damage claim with specific shipper but the decision is completely based on their findings and information. Initially, check nearby your property for the package that has been shipped.
                                Secondly, check in your neighbor area if the package has been accidentally shipped to their residence. Still, if you are not been able to locate package then you need to call shipping company such that they
                                can send their shipper to your residence within 24 hours. If Shipper is not able to locate package then claim will be initiated by the shipping company and this whole process will take maximum 30 days. While
                                your claim gets processing we are not responsible for any of the replaced or lost orders. All the replacement parts will be ordered again until the claim of yours get settled.
                            </p>

                            <b>What if my product arrives damaged?</b>

                            <p>
                                If the order you receive is damaged or opened. Instantly tell this to a shipper that you are refusing this order due to the damage found. But if the damaged or opened order is delivered in your absence then
                                you need to contact a shipping company. You only get 24 hours to give us the information about receiving of damaged product. We will not take any responsibility of damaged claim after 24 hours.
                            </p>

                            <b>Do you offer exchanges or replacement parts?</b>
